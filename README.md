This is the repo of our COMS 4995 Applied Computer Vision semester project: an ensemble method classification tool for EEG diagnoses.

Authors: Raman Odgers, Akhil Golla, Vinayak Kannan, Sohan Kshirsagar

# Github: AppliedCV-HMS
This repo includes all relevant exploratory, data processing, and training files.
The files here are not intended to be run but to show the work by the team to build our final product model.

# Huggingface: HMSDemo
We also have a live deployment for our model, hosted on a Huggingface Space [here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/ramanodgers/HMSDemo). 
This is synced with another github repo for a smoother workflow: [here](https://github.com/ramanodgers/HMSDemo).

You should be able to drag and drop an EEG file on the huggingface space and receive an accurate EEG classification. 
We provide an 'example_eeg.parquet' file for this purpose in the demo repository.
